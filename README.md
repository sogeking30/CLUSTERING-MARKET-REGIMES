## 📖 About This Project

CLUSTERING-MARKET-REGIMES is a Python application that identifies bull and bear market regimes. It uses a method called the Wasserstein Distance to analyze return distributions. This software is based on the research by Horvath et al., 2021. The tool includes:

- WK-means algorithm
- Synthetic data generators
- Validation metrics

This application can reproduce results from the original paper using SPY data.
